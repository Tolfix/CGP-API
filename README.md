# ‚≠ê | CPG-API
CPG-API is being used to create products, invoices, orders, transactions and payments for customers, to grow your business.

# üß∞ | Setup
Setting up `CPG` can be done in various of ways, but by the far easiet is by using `Docker`.
You can pull the latest `docker` image from `tolfixorg/cpg:latest` from `DockerHub`.

`CPG` also needs `env` vars added, which you can find some documents from [`.env.example`](), those added with `(optional)` can be ignored if you don't feel the need of them, but the others are required to make `CPG` functional.

## Installing
`CPG` requires the following
* Node.js
* Typescript - 4.3.5
* MongoDB
* Git

1. Clone repository 
```txt
git clone https://github.com/Tolfix/CPG-API
```
2. Install dependencies
```txt
npm install
```
3. Install `TypeScript`
```txt
npm install -g typescript@4.3.5
```
## Building
`CPG` is built from `TypeScript`, thus simple run it by using the compiler.
```txt
tsc -b
npm run build
```

## Running
You can run `CPG` by using `npm run start` or `node ./build/Main.js`.
Would recommend to use `pm2`.
# üé® | Plugins
Plugins allows you to install others features to CPG. Be aware it can be `dangerous` due to plugins get accessed to alot, you can trust `Tolfix` owns plugins, or plugins you created yourself, otherwise there is no guarantee.

## Installing
You can install new plugins by modifying ENV PLUGIN as a array
`PLUGINS=["cpg-plugin-discord-webhook", "cpg-plugin-"]`
This will install the plugin by `npm`.

## Deleting
Simply remove the plugin as you added the plugin reverse.
